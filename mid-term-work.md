    1.	Examine your business or system at home information and records. Identify the information that is most important to you.
    2.	Locate the important information and determine how it is stored.

    4.	Try to identify how you would detect if any of these attacks were to take place.
    5.	Choose the type of attack that you feel would be most devastating and develop an attack strategy.
    6.	Now Begin with the list of attacks and the attack strategy that you developed in previous steps.
    7.	Now look at each attack and determine the most appropriate security service to prevent or detect attack.
    8.	When you have your list, determine if the accountability service is needed to allow any of the other services to function. If so, add this to your list where necessary.
    9.	Prioritize your list in terms of which services are the most important to implement.
    10.	If all the security services are implemented, would you be able to detect or prevent the attack strategy that you developed in assignment?
